# Note about Site Realibility Engineering


## Devops vs SRE

### For Devops:
- Reduce organizational silos
- Accept failure is normal
- Implement gradual change
- Leverage Tooling and automation
- Meausure everything


### For SRE:
" class SRE implement Devops"

- Reduce organizational silos =>  ownership
- Accept failure is normal => blameless post mordem
- Implement gradual change => Reduce costs of failure
- Leverage Tooling and automation => Automate this year job away
- Meausure everything => Measure toil and reliability


* One you implement Devops/SRe in your team, teach your customer
- how to interact with your service / product
- Teach your costumer how to Devops/SRE with you. Expose your API and teach them
In this way your customer may also share thier practices with your team
This exchange of practices at the end may reduce issues and increase communication.


# Main SRE

1. Realibility is the most important feature
2. Users decides reliability, not monitoring
3. Well Engineering:  Soft=99.9%, Ops=99.9%, Bis=99.9% 
 
### NOTE:
Detect failures before it happen, that guides to prevent them.
