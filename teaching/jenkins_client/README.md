# Java based Jenkins client 

# How to install 

1. Download the jar file from your jenkins master.
```
$ wget https://jenkins.diginsite.net/jenkins/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar
```
This will down load "jenkins-cli.jar" file.

2. Test the jar file
```
$ java -jar jenkins-cli.jar --help
```
You can help something like below
```
Neither -s nor the JENKINS_URL env var is specified.
Jenkins CLI
Usage: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s URL] command [opts...] args...
Options:
-s URL       : the server URL (defaults to the JENKINS_URL env var)
-http        : use a plain CLI protocol over HTTP(S) (the default; mutually exclusive with -ssh and -remoting)
-ssh         : use SSH protocol (requires -user; SSH port must be open on server, and user must have registered a public key)
-remoting    : use deprecated Remoting channel protocol (if enabled on server; for compatibility with legacy commands or command modes only)
-i KEY       : SSH private key file used for authentication (for use with -ssh or -remoting)
-p HOST:PORT : HTTP proxy host and port for HTTPS proxy tunneling. See https://jenkins.io/redirect/cli-https-proxy-tunnel
-noCertificateCheck : bypass HTTPS certificate check entirely. Use with caution
-noKeyAuth   : dont try to load the SSH authentication private key. Conflicts with -i
-user        : specify user (for use with -ssh)
-strictHostKey : request strict host key checking (for use with -ssh)
-logger FINE : enable detailed logging from the client
-auth [ USER:SECRET | @FILE ] : specify username and either password or API token (or load from them both from a file);
for use with -http, or -remoting but only when the JNLP agent port is disabled

The available commands depend on the server. Run the help command to
see the list.

# How to use

This site presents the case to use jenkins-cli with http. You can do similar procedure with ssh

1. Update your publick key in Jenkins master

Go to Your account name => configure => SSH public keys, and copy your public key on the space.

Also you can get your token or the token of the account you are going to use by:

Go to your account name => Configure => Click on Show API token, and copy it in a hidden file as:
```
$ echo "user:token" > /hiden/directory/.secrets
```

2. Run the 

```
$ java -jar /path/to/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://hostname:8080/jenkins help

OR

$ java -jar /path/to/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://hostname:8080/jenkins -auth @/hidden/directory/.secrets  help

# How to run groovy scripts

To run a groovy script directly in Jenkins master:
```
$ java -jar /path/to/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://hostname:8080/jenkins -auth @/hidden/directory/.secrets groovy = < my_script.groovy
```

In here :

- groovy  is a subcommand from jenkins-cli.jar
- "=" instructs jenkins-cli.jar to expect stdin to provide a script to run
- "<" feeds the contentof the groovy script to jenkins-cli.jar
